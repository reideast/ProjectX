These steps to set up Meteor deployment was syntheized from these guides (either one, they're pretty equivalent):
https://www.coshx.com/blog/2016/08/19/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-1-4-app-to-heroku/
https://medium.com/@gge/deploy-a-meteor-1-3-application-to-heroku-cda1f68ca20a#.6kudtznue
and also the heroku & travis docs, mainly:
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/heroku/
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/

Create an account on Travis:
Note: Use your github login, and make sure you're signed up for the free Github Education pack with that github account
https://education.travis-ci.com/

Create an account on Heroku:
https://signup.heroku.com/

configure a new, blank app on heroku:
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
New
Create New App
Name: enter the name you want to be your http://YOUR_HEROKU_NAME_HERE.herokuapp.com
Region: EU or US

after the app is created, you'll see it on https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
click the app, then go into Settings
Reveal Config Vars
add one for ROOT_URL, set equal to: http://YOUR_HEROKU_NAME_HERE.herokuapp.com
scroll down to Buildpacks
remove node.js buildpack
Add Buildpack: https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse.git

install Heroku CLI on your computer:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install

while you're at it, install Travis CLI:
https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation
(note: this requires ruby 2.3 or greater)

open shell
cd to your existing app directory
(which should have a git repot already initialized)

put in your heroku account credentials (saves it for this directory):
heroku login

    Optional: testing heroku only (no travis yet)
        tell heroku that this your app:
        heroku git:remote -a YOUR_HEROKU_NAME_HERE

        make sure meteor is working locally, then make sure you've made a git commit recently

        push it manually to heroku:
        git push heroku master

create a text file called ".travis.yml" in your app's root directory
paste in everything in between the """'s:
GitBranchNameYouWantToDeploy is the git branch that will go online through heroku (no other git branches will get pushed online)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
language: node_js
node_js:
- '0.12'
services:
- mongodb
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  app:
    GitBranchNameYouWantToDeploy: YOUR_HEROKU_NAME_HERE
  buildpack: https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse.git
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
save the file, close it

on the command line, run:
travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key

this will automatically place an encrypted api key inside your .travis.yml file under deploy:api_key:secure:

all that's left is to commit that change into your branch called GitBranchNameYouWantToDeploy
push that branch to github.com
travis picks up that change within 5 minutes or so, and starts a build, which will end up on http://YOUR_HEROKU_NAME_HERE.herokuapp.com

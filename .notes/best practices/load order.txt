// TODO: rearrange into load order per new meteor standards

// TODO: 

Special Directories:
imports/
    any directory named imports/ is not loaded anywhere, and must be imported using js "import" statement
client/
server/
    still work the same (note: these rules are applied recursively, i.e. code inside imports/server/passwords.js is not sent to the client at all)
public/
    served as-is to client. not parsed by meteor. references "public/image.jpg" as src="/image.jpg"
private/
    server only. accessible via "Assets API": http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/assets_getText
tests/
    not loaded or used anywhere by meteor. useful for test runners that work outside of Meteor's framework
.anything/
    not loaded
programs/, packages/, cordova-build-override/
    not loaded
